This application is basically designed to make the user understand the difference and similarities between the different arithmetic representations of integers. The key idea is to be able to observe and understand that some of the arithmetic representations behave isomorphically and hence any of them could be interchangeably used at the backend without the knowledge of the user.

## How to use the Application

**Step-1:** Select any two rows that you want to add and press the ADD button.

**Step-2:** The result will be highlighted as well as displayed in the results table.

**Overflow:** If the resultant of the two numbers cannot be represented in a given number of "bits", then it is an overflow which is indicated by the overflow flags. ( The actual values requiring a higher number of bits will be displayed in the result table for reference).

**Step-3:** Press the reset button for adding a new set of numbers.
